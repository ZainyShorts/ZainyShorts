### 👋 Hey there, I'm **@ZainyShorts**!

- 👀 Passionate about **coding** (and occasionally debugging my life decisions).
- 🌱 Currently **learning to code**... and also learning how not to scream at error messages.
- 📫 Wanna reach out?  
   - ✉️ Email me: **zainyshorts@gmail.com**  
   - 📞 Call/Text me (but memes preferred): **+92 0339 6456958**
- ⚡ **Fun fact:** I write code that sometimes works... *on the first try!* (It's rare, but it happens. Like a solar eclipse 🌚✨)
